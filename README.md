Hi there, I’m YexuanXiao.
 
I’m passionate about coding, reading, and writing. When I’m not immersed in code, you’ll find me enjoying music, movies, games, and anime.

My research interests lie in multi-paradigm programming languages and system programming. I work with C++, C#, and TypeScript, and I’m currently learning Rust.

I have a strong love for open source and am always excited to contribute to open source projects.

In addition to what pin has showcased, I have also written the following software:

[deque](https://github.com/YexuanXiao/deque) - An efficient deque container that accurately conforms to the C++ standard

[rfc4648-base64](https://github.com/YexuanXiao/rfc4648-base64) - A base64 utility library written using C++ algorithm style

[rfc4648-afo](https://github.com/YexuanXiao/rfc4648-afo) - A base64 utility library written using C++ ranges algorithm style

[win32lib](https://github.com/YexuanXiao/win32lib) - A Win32 wrapper library that follows C++ best practices
