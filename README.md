Hi there, I’m YexuanXiao.
 
I’m passionate about coding, reading, and writing. When I’m not immersed in code, you’ll find me enjoying music, movies, games, and anime.

My research interests lie in multi-paradigm programming languages and system programming. I work with C++, C#, and TypeScript, and I’m currently learning Rust.

I have a strong love for open source and am always excited to contribute to open source projects.
